Okay I hear you. Okay, so the online presenters and our three finalists here are ready.

Okay, so the time for Hanoi Dang, we'll start in three, two, one.

**Hanoi Dang (Presenter):** Hello everyone. We at Hanoi Dang today, we are really honored to be the first team to present our business plan for Pepsi to capture the Northern market. Okay, so to start, I want to talk about the market overview. So the market, uh the carbonated soft drink market in the North of Vietnam has shown recent growth, it has shown significant growth in recent years with the cola segments dominating the market and mainly consumed by millennials and generation Z. These two generations of young people is shifting from being labeled by society to defining themselves, highlighting a need for their self-expression. However, the the soft, the carbonated soft drink market in the Northern is currently dominated by Coca-Cola, one of our biggest competitor with their uh with their core values of connection and uh happiness. Okay, so as a brand of boldness of uh dynamic and energetic, Pepsi needs to stand up in the market by targeting a group of young consumers by by tailoring their message to resonate with a Northern cultural identity. Okay, so to sum up our summary consists of two initiatives. The first one is to expand its presence by upgrading up-and-coming areas with renewed message aligned with their drivers of choice. And the second initiative is to reverse its market share by improving the overall distribution with an objective of capturing 1.3% of market share in six months. Okay, so towards to achieve this objective, Pepsi needs to target a significant group of young audience in the North, uh who are socially active and driven by self-expression as well as personal development and their core insight is that why they have a big passion and big dreams. They are they are sometimes they are facing uh societal pressure which uh which hinder them from pursuing their dreams. Uh so getting on this uh big idea is to write, uh is to shine with a key message of hoping to have a brand that's shining. So through this marketing plan, Pepsi aims to get the target users to increase the frequency of buying Pepsi and become loyal to the brand by implementing a marketing plan that taps into localized cultural relevance and making consumer connecting with Pepsi as a part of their personal identity. So uh for uh sorry, so by by this marketing plan, or Pepsi aims to turn to get their consumers from the current stage of keeping their dreams inside into the desired stage of feeling empowered by Pepsi to pursue their dreams and use Pepsi to celebrate for every of their milestones in life. So for our deployment plan, we focus on three key phases, of which uh which solve the issues from the customer journey. Uh the first phase is in our first phase, uh we want to build strong brand awareness by uh by by collecting Pepsi's with a not Northern values by a Pepsi event, you see, their are certain places, uh lots of times Pepsi's useful energy with a pride of the natural organization through a music and B collaboration with local Vietnam and our last uh our last phase we want to identify Pepsi's brand role as a refreshing companion in summer with a summer festival featuring local artists and regional highlights. And also we want to optimize with a supporting tactics such as activations, uh building a community to enhance brand loyalty and special that we want to create a Pepsi limited edition packaging, uh which include some illustrators of Northern regions such as Hanoi, uh Quang Ninh, Haiphong, and so on. Okay, so for our sales plan, our sales priority, uh top down will be the modern trade, traditional trade, online channels. And also the supplementing face of current distribution network. The distribution network is not balanced between the urban and rural areas. So in order to improve the product availability, the plan will emphasize on for key priorities. Less one. Our distribution network, partnerships, TVL relationships, management and events. Next slide. For our finance strategy, uh considering the current distribution that Pepsi is doing in Vietnam, we're going to spend significantly more for supplying in order to uh increase this the distribution coverage uh in Northern region and uh marketing, sales and human resource are all supporting this tactic by optimizing uh optimizing distribution of salaries and increasing marketing return on investment. And in an optimistic scenario, we expect a ROI of 721 gaining a 3.5% goal in 2025 by optimizing capacity and increasing revenue by uh minimizing implementation cost. But so can as a support for the cola game-changing market for Pepsi, our human resource plan needs to align with this solutions for short-term goals. So we find the problems that the low rate perceived in the SVP employees due to the uncertainty in career path. So we are going to give uh some solutions to the HRP programs, specialize for sales functions to align the sales objectives to the business uh before optimization. So we also release the total one package with a 3B salary guide and a conversation package personalized for sales team. So to however to align all the people to all the workforce of Pepsi, we are going to having some growth conditions for training, empowering talent to decision-making and upskilling and reskilling to our join a lifelong learning uh for the Pepsi workforce. So going to the slide, we are going to have a strategic plan. The preparation phase will start in the one for of 2024, and our initiatives will start from 2025 with uh juice seasons starting from 10:00 a.m. and harvesting season for which is including high demand for workforce sales of. So here are our HR management and workforce strategies. We have further assess and our communication approach to this. So get back to the Pepsi drop. We have uh told the Pepsi drop of low implementation uh of the low implementation cost by the disaster in the Pepsi production. We are having two problems to identify. The first one is the delay in the production happens. So which is we having the issues of the availability of products in the marketing. We having some production delays in the supply chain. We having the low competition and low awareness together with stress increase for the workforce of Pepsi and we are having uh increasing payments for the damages. So we are having some solutions which is we are going to build it up uh in order to even to three levels by focusing Pepsi Coca-Cola and we are also going to improve the communication both internal and external to. Thank you so much team Hanoi Dang, for the presentation. And now, it's time for the Q&A session from the judges. So the judges will ask the question in a row. Please remember the question. And then you will have five minutes to answer all the questions from the the judges. Judges, the stage is yours.


**Judge:** Thank you very much. Um, thank you for a great presentation, and I really enjoyed your work. Um, congratulations on getting to the final. Um, and the way you presented the information is excellent. Very good. I'm going to come up with very quick questions. One is around the question of pricing, um, and how you sort of compete with uh Coca-Cola on pricing, and the level of price elasticity, price demand. And in terms of the distribution, um, how do you sort of what advantages do you use to get Pepsi onto the supermarket shelf from and how do you distribute Pepsi relative to Coke?  Um, there's more questions, I'll just stop those two.


**Hanoi Dang:** Um, I have two questions. So first one would be um if you are choosing Coke as your source of growth, then um what would be your advantage or what advantage would be you leverage to compete against them? Um, because I don't see a lot of competitive analysis in your presentation. Um, secondly, um have you researched what have Pepsi done in the past, um, to see whether, you know, your ideas has been tested or uh has been, you know, had any failures or successes in the past. So those are my two questions.


**Judge:** I have two questions as well. One question is on top of one answer, has, uh, besides many factors that you have listed on the communication on the activities that you want to fight against Coke. But which aspects you feel like is most detectable for you to cover consumers. Is it the communication or the events or activations or something else. It's a first question. The second question is that uh our question here is about how to beat Coke in North. So do you have any research that the Northern consumers and the Southern consumers differ?


**Judge:** So my question is regarding to HR because I saw you do a lot of things, um, like it feels like it's extra for the sales team. If you able to pick to prioritize one or two activities only, which would you choose to do implement for the sales team and why?


**Hanoi Dang (Presenter):** Thank you so much the judges for the question. I'm sure that the questions from the judges are very challenging for the team. So now the team will have a few seconds to note down some of the key ideas before they answer the questions.


**Hanoi Dang (Presenter):** Teams, time's up, are you ready for answering the question?

(Sound of the team responding)

**Hanoi Dang (Presenter):** So now the time for the team Hanoi Dang to answer the questions from the judges will start in three, two, one.


**Hanoi Dang (Presenter):** So the hope is such, we have, many, I have so many initiatives to promote the alignment and engagement of the sales team. So if I am going to choose one initiative that I am really afraid is might on the top list of my priority, I'm going to choose the total reward packages and the career path development programs. As I say, their are uh as the employee of the certain level of are mainly is not there are highly seasoned employees. It's not officially they are they are officially employed, so they are having a career path somehow uncertainty. So we are going to introduce a more certain career path as I have introduced in the slide that we have going to. If you have true promotions, uh by performance promotions, you will become the official employee of the certain level of Vietnam. And the second thing we are going to personalize the first, the total reward package, which including the conversations and including the 3B salary, pipe or performance by for performance and a promotion. And 2B, the conversation we will having some uh some personalized conversations for the uh for the sales, like helping the sales when they are going into the rural areas, they are needing more personalized advice and we are we are going to they're needing a lot of feed to to boost their confidence, so we are going to have some kind of conversation like that to further support them in the confident way of they are doing their work. So together we are having a clear career path and uh the development in competence sessions and total reward packages. For the question on the differentiation between Coke and Pepsi, uh so the difference in market share came from the fact that people in the South, they are more active, they are uh they are always looking to the future, but people in the North, we usually value uh traditional values more. Uh that's why uh even we look at the the historical importance of Coca-Cola and they always based on the value of family and traditional values. So for this campaign, in order to in order to resonate more with the people in the Northern region and increase demand for Pepsi, we're going to add more values of uh we still encouraging young people to be bold to be um uh enthusiastic about their lifestyle, but still has to base on the values they have in a family context.


**Hanoi Dang (Presenter):** Okay, so I will first answer the question on the pricing, the price signal for Coca-Cola. So I uh we are uh we are planning to apply the same price for every regions in the North as uh we didn't position Coke, we didn't position Pepsi, sorry, we didn't position Pepsi as a premium product. And I think that price is like reasonable for reasons in the North to afford, but we will apply different for product categories for each reasons. Maybe uh at the rural areas, who will apply more like smaller size or smaller package of product with a more affordable price for them. For the second question about the what we have research on the Pepsi's historical campaign in the past and uh the as well as the research on the difference in consumer behavior of North and South regions. Uh we have all research on these two issues. So we have uh can came to a conclusion is that uh Pepsi's uh campaign marketing campaign in the past has like laid some semantics with our with our understanding, but I would use that the message to the company is not resistant and Pepsi did not uh like successful successful in differentiate its like favorite factor and their like image from Coca-Cola. So I think that is the reason why the past campaign have applied the same like the same tactics and the same communications, but did not uh bring much effective. And for the North and South, we have uh we have read like several surveys and several reports on how the culture of North and South regions affect affect their behavior and goodness that not consumers value traditional values and uh they are like more collectively in terms of family. Thank you so much team Hanoi Dang.
